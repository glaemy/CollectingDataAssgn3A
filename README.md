# CollectingDataAssgn3A
This dataset has been sourced from Kaggle. It consists of information on user preference data from 73,516 users on 12,294 anime. Each user can add anime to their completed list and give it a rating and this data set is a compilation of those ratings. 

**The dataset comprises information about various anime, presenting a comprehensive overview of each entry. The key columns include:**
  
  anime_id - myanimelist.net's unique id identifying an anime.
  
  name - full name of anime.
  
  genre - comma separated list of genres for this anime.
  
  type - movie, TV, OVA, etc.
  
  episodes - how many episodes in this show. (1 if movie).
 
  rating - average rating out of 10 for this anime.
 
  members - number of community members that are in this anime's "group".

**In my exploration of this data I will be exploring the following questions:**
  1. Is the popularity of a genre affected by its type, i.e., whether it is a TV series, movie, or OVA?
  2. What is the relationship between genre and rating?
